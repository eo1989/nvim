"==========[ ModifyLineEndDelimiter ]==========
" Description:
"	This function takes a delimiter character and:
"	- removes that character from the end of the line if the character at the end
"	of the line is that character
"	- removes the character at the end of the line if that character is a
"	delimiter that is not the input character and appends that character to
"	the end of the line
"	- adds that character to the end of the line if the line does not end with
"	a delimiter
